        Hello! <br> 
        My name is John Bostater and this is my website.<br> 
        <br>
        I am self taught developer and I am currently studying Cybersecurity (Computer Science) at Arizona State University.
        <br>
        I love learning about both developing software as well as setting up protections for it.
        <br> 
        I have found a deep love for computers to where I can lose track behind a keyboard and develop for hours.            
    </p>
